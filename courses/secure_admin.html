	  <P ALIGN=left><b>Catalog Description: </b>
Introduction to Network Security course focuses on overall security processes with particular emphasis on security policy design & management. This course also provides a survey of security technologies, products & solutions. Hands-on skill labs focus on firewall design, the installation, configuration and maintenance of routers and firewall and AAA implementation. Virtual Private Networks implemented with routers and firewalls are also introduced.</p>


<P ALIGN=left><b>Educational Objectives: </b>
As a result of taking this course, students will develop a working knowledge of:
<UL>
<LI> Security terminology, the purpose and goals of network security policies and various security threats and vulnerabilities;
<LI> Different types of authentication, including Kerberos, CHAP, digital certificates, tokens, biometrics, mutual authentication and multi-factor authentication;
<LI> Major types of attacks and malicious codes that commonly affect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of networks;
<LI> The business impact of security breaches with countermeasures and best practices to prevent or mitigate their effect;
<LI> Concepts and practices of remote access, including VPNs, RADIUS authentication, TACACS+, Layer 2 and point-to-point Tunneling Protocols, IPSec and Secure Shell
<LI> Email vulnerabilities and methods to safeguard against them, along with the benefits of PGP and S/MIME;
<LI> Protocols including those commonly exploited by attackers on the Internet such as SSL/TLC, HTTPS, Buffer Overflow, ActiveX and SMTP;
<LI> Centralized services such as LPDA;
<LI> FPNs and RAS technology;
<LI> Best practices to protect network media from corruption, theft and catastrophic loss;
<LI> DMZs, NAT, FLANs and tunneling for securing network topologies;
<LI> Intrusion detection systems for both host-based and network-based systems;
<LI> Security baselines and operating system hardening practices;
<LI> Basics of algorithms and how they are used in modern cryptography, including the differences between asymmetric and symmetric algorithms and the basics of cryptography (PKI certificates);
<LI> Physical security such as where data storage systems are located within an organization, biometrics, and fire safety;
<LI> Disaster recovery planning, its process and procedures;
<LI> Risk identification and documentation.
