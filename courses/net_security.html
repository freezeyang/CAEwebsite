	  <P ALIGN=left><b>Course Objectives:</b> The main goal of this course is to provide you with a fundamental understanding of network security principles and implementation. You will learn about the technologies used and principles involved in creating a secure computer networking environment. You will learn about authentication, the types of attacks and malicious code that may be used against your network, the threats and countermeasures for e-mail, Web applications, remote access, and file and print services. A variety of security topologies will be  discussed as well as technologies and concepts used for providing secure communications channels, secure internetworking devices, and network medium. Further, you will learn about intrusion detection systems, firewalls, and physical security concepts.  In addition, security policies, disaster recovery, and computer forensics are covered.  Aside from learning the technologies involved in security, you will understand the daily tasks involved with managing and troubleshooting those technologies. To reinforce the concepts learned, you will complete a variety of hands-on labs using tools such as Ethereal, Back Orifice, Packet Tracer, TCP Dump and WinSnort.  Student seeking graduate level credit will complete additional project assignments.</p>

<P ALIGN=left><b>Course Materials</b> Materials for the course are posted on the UIS Blackboard . The materials include PowerPoint slides, class announcements, a student discussion area, the course syllabus, test dates, labs, projects and other information relevant to the course
</p>

<P ALIGN=left><b>Assignments: </b>
You may submit project assignments in class on the due date or by e-mail with a date stamp of 6:00 P.M. on the due date. Email submissions should be sent as an attachment in Microsoft Word format. Assignments turned in late will have 10% deducted for each class overdue. 
</p>

<P ALIGN=left><b>Grading and Evaluation Criteria: </b> <br>40% of the grade is based on a midterm and a final examination. Both examinations are cumulative and may be given in a multiple choice and short essay format. An in-class review will be held prior to each examination.
40% of the grade is based on completing the case project assignments for each topic and recording these lab activities in a notebook. Students are asked to obtain a small notebook for keeping notes on the hands-on projects at the end of each topic. The notes should include the following for each lab:
<OL><LI>A brief statement describing the objective of the project; 
<LI>All tools/applications used to complete the project;
<LI>Comments that you can use once the class is over to help describe the project process;
<LI>Any helpful tips or advice that you might use in the future;
<LI>The results of the hands-on-project. </OL>
 Case project assignments can be downloaded from the course's Blackboard site. 
10% of the grade is based on quizzes. Quizzes are announced one class in advance and be from 3 to 5 questions in any format.
10% of the grade is based on class participation.<p></p>
