<H3>Some Advanced Ideas</H3>
<OL>
  <LI>Unplug your Ethernet cable now and then when you are not actively 
  uploading or downloading 
  <UL>
    <LI>Unplug it at the wall 
    <LI>Or better, buy a coupler and a 1m extension cable and unplug it at your 
    physical desktop 
    <LI>Even if you are imperfect, it will make many hackers go away 
    <LI>They can't sell your machine on a botnet black market if they can't 
    control it 
    <LI>If you are down 80% of the time, they need a 5x larger DDOS attack 
    <LI><I>Or do you WANT to be part of someone's botnet?</I>

  <UL>
    <LI>Think of it like the back seat of your car 
    <LI>You can put things there, but you can't leave them there 
    <LI>Your mobile devices are not your bff's 
    <LI><I>Or do you LIKE losing data?</I> </LI></UL><BR><BR><IMG width="30%" src="aspa_files/fullphone.jpg">

  <LI>Use plain text as often as possible 
  <UL>
    <LI>Open your email as plain text in a simple mail reader, nothing fancy 
    (learn unix, not angry birds!) 
    <LI>Encourage your correspondents to use plain text unless absolutely 
    necessary 
    <LI>Generally avoid fancy new software that promises to make your life 
    easier (it's a lie!) 
    <LI>Use computing to be efficient and powerful, not mindless and trendy

  Chatham!"

    letter of each word: 
    <LI>"2014 Olympiann Graciee Goldd iss fromm Chathamm!"

  <CENTER><IMG width="30%" src="aspa_files/gracie.jpg"> </CENTER><BR><BR>
  <LI>Write down your passwords but steganographically (Hide the passphrase 
  among other text): 
  <UL>
    <LI>"No 2014 Olympian will know that my password is in this sentence, except 
    Gracie Gold, who is from Chatham!" 
    <LI>Use your own character for spaces -- _, #, or even yy 
    <LI>Post it notes are actually good because you can't steal them 
    electronically 
    <LI><I>Or do you like FORGETTING your passwords? Or GIVING them to whoever 
    reads your post-it-notes?</I> </LI></UL><BR><BR>

  <LI>Designate a computer or laptop outside your firewall for docking USB 
  devices 
  <UL>
    <LI>And treat USB devices like Starbucks coffee cups -- you can reuse them, 
    but it's better to retire them 
    <LI>Use the cloud or email to transfer from that machine into your secure 
    area 
    <LI>Actually they make nice data backups

  <LI>It's really Cyber Power, like economic sanctions and trade embargos (or 
  blockades?) <BR><BR>
  <LI>It is not our job to make computer hardware and software perfectly secure 
  <BR><BR>
  <LI>Some of the flaws in the systems will be exploited by US cyber warriors in 
  the future <BR><BR>
  <LI>US Taxpayers should not be fixing overseas computer systems by making 
  Microsoft and Google work for everyone <BR><BR>
  <LI>No one says it, but the reason the NSA does much of what it does is for 
  fighting cyberwar, not just fighting terrorism <BR><BR>

  corporations with <BR><BR>
